# Selected Tag- and Text-Conditioned Generated Music
> Settings: In terms of tag-conditioned music generation, we initiate with a "start-of-song" event, then feed relevant tags into either MST-Tags-Small or MST-Tags. This is followed by a "start-of-notes" event to allow the model to begin generating notes. For text-conditioned music generation, we input the text embedding corresponding to the provided text into MST-Text and use a "start-of-song" event to prompt the model to start generating notes.


## I. Multiple Control:

# MetaScore Quantative Examples:
> 
To evaluate the quality of our dataset, we used the rating entry (MetaScore-Raw) as an indicator. This rating, which ranges from 1 to 5 (with 5 being the highest), serves as a structured measure of perceived music quality. To demonstrate that even lower-rated entries can still be suitable for use, we randomly selected 10 samples from three categories: low ratings (below 3 or not rated), mid-range ratings (3–4), and high ratings (above 4). These examples illustrate the overall usability and diversity of the dataset across different rating levels.

# MetaScore Annotation Examples
> We show annotation examples in MetaScore in the following table. The first two examples are from genre tagger test set with both true genre tags and inferred genre tags. Example 3,4, 6 and 7 are from those without true genre tags. Example 5 doesn't have inferred genre tags because they are from genre tagger training set. *Note that the following samples are not generated by AI.*
